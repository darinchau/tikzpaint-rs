pub const FILLER1: &'static str = "When you take a shit, if you think about it, you're not really taking at all. If anything, you're leaving, or dare I say, giving a shit. So why do we say that we're taking a shit when we're not taking anything? Well, the truth is, you are taking something. What are you taking? You're taking time. You're taking the time to shit, which gets shortened down to take a shit, which means, yes, the word shit in the phrase take a shit is not a noun. It is a verb. And this is true for almost any of the things that you take time to do. You can take time to shower, you can take time to nap, you can take time to go on vacation, you can take time to go on a break, you can take time to piss, you can take time to walk, and you can stop for a second and take time to photograph and most intrestingly, you can take time to dump or just take a dump, which I think is the clearest example that the thing you are taking is not a noun, but a verb. Because when you take a dump, you are literally dumping. Now if you took a nap, you could just say that you napped. If you took a shower, you can say you showered. If you took a piss, you can say you pissed. But if you took a dump, you cannot say that you dumped despite the fact that you literally just dumped. I mean, talk about holy shit.";

pub const FILLER2: &'static str = r#"Robert Lafee Citron (April 14, 1925 – January 16, 2013) was the longtime Treasurer-Tax Collector of Orange County, California, when it declared Chapter 9 bankruptcy on December 6, 1994. The bankruptcy was brought on by Citron's investment strategies, which seemed to be an effort to earn high incomes for the county, without raising taxes, through risky, leveraged positions in bonds. The strategy paid out at first. In 1994, a cash crunch occurred when interest rates increased and financiers for the county required increased collateral from the county. It was later revealed that Citron relied upon a mail-order astrologer and a psychic for interest rate predictions as the county's finances began to falter.

Born in Los Angeles, Citron grew up in Burbank and Hemet. His father, Jesse, was the doctor who put an end to alcoholic W. C. Fields's love of scotch. He attended the University of Southern California but did not graduate. In 1960 he was hired by the Tax Collection department of Orange County, throughout the years he was promoted and by the time he ran for election was department supervisor. He ran for the elected position of Tax Collector in 1970 where he won. Three years later Orange County would merge the offices of tax collector and treasurer and this is when Citron's title became Treasurer-Tax Collector.

Citron controlled several Orange County funds including the General Fund, the Investment Pool, and the treasury Commingled Pool. He sent out the county's tax bills with catchy slogans, such as "Taxes paid on time never draw fines." He won re-election seven times; in his last election victory, his opponent, John Moorlach, charged that his handsome gains were the result of risky betting.

As controller of the various Orange County funds, Citron had taken a highly leveraged position using repurchase agreements (repos) and floating rate notes (FRNs). The loss incurred by the use of these financial instruments reached the amount of $2 billion and was caused by being too highly leveraged for rising federal interest rates. In other words, if federal interest rates had not risen, the massive trading position would have been a substantially profitable position; if interest rates did rise, the trading position would result in substantial losses. In fact, rates rose.

The Orange County funds, managed by Citron, were worth $8 billion. However, Citron went out to the repo market and leveraged the County Pools to amounts ranging from 158% to over 292%. To obtain this degree of leverage, he used treasury bonds as collateral. Profits of the fund were excessive for a period of time and Citron resorted to concealing the excess earnings. He pleaded guilty to improperly transferring securities from the Orange County General Fund to the Orange County Treasury Commingled Pool.

Although regulators and the county's financial counterparties had already begun scrutinizing Citron's risky investment strategy as early as 1992, following an article in the trade publication, Derivatives Week, the county's finances did not begin to unravel until early 1994. At that time, the Federal Reserve Bank began to raise US interest rates, causing many securities in Orange County's investment pools to fall in value. As a result, dealers were requesting extra margin payments from Orange County. These extra margin payments were funded in part by another bond issue made by Orange County; the size of that bond issue was $600 million. However, this fix proved to be only temporary. In December 1994, Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) realized what was going on, and blocked the "rolling over" of $1.25 billion in repos ("rollover" essentially means issuing another repo when the previous one ends, but at the new prevailing interest rate). At that point some claim that Orange County was left with no recourse other than to file for bankruptcy. While the county was in bankruptcy, every one of its program budgets was cut, about 3,000 public employees were discharged, and all services were reduced.

Financial scholar John C. Hull later described the incident as "the classic example" of an institution initially earning a profit through risky trades, becoming complacent about risk as a result, and then making disastrous losses.

Facing 14 years in prison, Citron pleaded guilty to six felony counts and three special enhancements. Charges also included filing a false and misleading financial summary to participants purchasing securities in the Orange County Treasury Investment Pool. Citron was sentenced to one year of work release and five years of supervised probation, and performed 1,000 hours of community service. He served a year in prison, where he was allowed to work in the commissary.

Citron died at the age of 87 on January 16, 2013."#;

pub const FILLER3: &'static str = r#"第一位呀Jolly姐，三十到尾架啦，佢老母臭撚話說填form果陣，佢已經專燈唔寫年齡果欄，然後身份證張copy又係擦左出生日期，咁我就好心提下佢，小姐呀，你年齡果欄漏咗喎，我一講完，佢老母就黎料啦
呢啲個人資料我唔想透露太多

屌！我心諗做乜鳩呀？你唔填，我點幫你match呀？咪同佢講，小姐，其實你唔填都無所謂，不過我地好難幫你搵對象

哦唔洗架啦，我自己搵得架啦

吓，咁你洗乜上黎呀？咁客氣比錢我公司賺又唔洗我地做野？

你地有無ｄ相薄果ｄ架，你拎黎我自己簡得啦

我屌佢咩，真係當呢度鴨店黎，唯有好婉轉咁同佢講我地唔想披露客人資料講到嘴都臭埋先知原來佢第一次黎婚姻介紹 搞左一輪，佢死都唔肯寫年齡，淨係話三十歲左右，講真，估都估鳩到佢應該三十到尾，唉女人真係天真，如果真係想結婚既，講真，年齡呢ｄ呃得邊個呀？

講返呀Jolly姐，認真講，條件就okay既，名牌大學畢業又有master，中環返工高級白領，應該就係果ｄ成日西曬面屌鳩ｄ男下屬廢柴既西女人，住就住中環果頭聽佢講就自己一個人住，應該家境都幾OKAY。

其實佢又唔算係港女既，起碼對比起我後來遇到既果ｄ，嘩你老母臭西有ｄ真係港過杜如風，咁佢就係真係無乜經驗，有時真知話佢搞笑好定ON鳩好

佢要求既對象條件都算合理既，五十歲以下，高學歷，高收入，咁我覺得以佢既條件，算合理，但問題係呢，佢唔單只係無婚姻介紹既經驗，而係我相信啦，就係連拍拖既經驗都無乜，呢樣真係大忌

事 頭婆吩咐過，遇到呢類比較梗既野，出街要睇實，咁我記得好快就約左佢第一次去speed dating，咁其實公司有幾種plan簡既，唔係賣廣告，講下姐，有ｄ就單對單，條件審核會嚴ｄ，亦唔會有第三者在場，咁最初我諗住推介呢種比 Jolly姐既，呢類就比較岩ｄ成熟ｄ既，因為佢地通常都中意私隱度高ｄ既，但係後來問佢ｄ拍拖經驗，佢ee哦哦我都估到佢無乜，唯有踢佢去幾對幾果ｄ睇 下情況先

咁第一次係三對三，係餐廳book左台果ｄ，過程都幾順利，話曬Jolly姐叫做高級白領，我其實睇好佢架

接完佢地入座之後我基本上就唔會留係現場架啦，通常坐多陣如果無乜特別野我收工添架啦，咁果晚係正常架無事發生既，一切都好順利直到我返撚左屋企１１點幾果陣電話響，打黎果個係果晚三個男士之一，佢打黎第一句就係話：子石，救命呀，我係差館，可唔可以黎保釋我

屌，我知出事

臭系，果晚我係十二點係沙田飛過去灣仔警署，保釋左果個我唔撚記得呀乜生，搞完成3點幾4點鐘，佢老母臭系呀乜生同我講，話佢被人屈非禮？

咁佢被人屈非禮關我撚事？關呀，點解呀，因為告佢非禮果個八婆就係Jolly姐呀屌你老母！

其 實件事係幾惹笑既，即係如果我唔需要零晨飛出去救佢既話。呀乜生一出黎喊撚曬口，唯有好似湊仔咁湊佢，問佢乜事，心諗唔通條友咁夠薑揸鳩Jolly姐個 波？佢話原來果晚佢地幾好傾，講開話又幾近Jolly姐屋企，咁條友咸咸濕濕諗住送佢返屋企順便整個下文，佢話就話落車果陣係咁咦錫左佢一啖跟住就賴左 野，我老母系都唔信佢啦，屌你兩個成年人，整個goodbye kiss就報警，玩鳩我咩？

我問佢，呀乜生，老老實實，你係咪有咸濕人？

邊知佢喊到好凄厲fi呢fat呢咁話好真係無

咁大家都係男人，雖然Jolly姐唔係話好正，但我都唔排除條友餓狗搶屎，唯有第日再去問下Jolly姐

後來我先知，其實我唔需要去搵Jolly姐，呢個諗法實在太天真太native，因為第朝我地鋪都未開呀Jolly姐已經call行曬馬係我地門口，佢老母系佢搵律師黎喎，話因為我地公司既不當安排而令佢被人非禮，要求賠償，嘩，我真係俾佢吹到啤一聲

都唔好話佢搵個律師黎隨時貴過我地可以賠到俾佢，佢仲要好撚認真咁屌鳩我地話我地搵埋d狗屎垃圾(Jolly姐原句應該無咁粗俗)信唔信佢爆料俾乜周乜周聽搞到我地公司名譽掃地諸如此類啦

我呢一世都記得佢攞隻爆曬青筋既手指指撚住我個鼻係公司門口商場裡面人來人往幾十人望撚住既情況底下屌柒我既個畫面，嘩，我真係果下頭都痛埋個腦one一聲幾乎暈低咁滯

後來呢，咁我地公司唔係話好大，但係都叫老字號，呀事頭婆又度縮唔想賠錢，結果搞黎搞去搞到我，搞左一輪話個套餐比Jolly姐，期間仲要又唉又西好似求佢要咁，係呀，件事完係完撚左，但係我既惡夢正式開始....

我本來呢，就以為以呀Jolly姐既身份加上佢見過鬼應該怕黑應該唔撚會再黎搵我啦掛，我後來真係覺得太傻太天真太樂觀，因為呀Jolly係癲到得閒度有熱誠度每日，係每日好撚準時咁係lunch hour打黎問我今晚有無dating

呀 Jolly係好撚搞鬼，佢係唔會直接問佢有無dating，而你亦都唔可以直接答佢話今晚有dating叫佢黎，你話今晚有呀你黎唔黎？佢會當堂屌撚柒你 以為我依家好想去你果d爛鬼dating呀？你以為你地公司有咩好呀，上次件事呀，你知唔知，搞到我要去睇心理醫生呀

屌屌屌屌屌，我就真係就黎要去心理醫生呀Jolly姐你有無好介紹呀仆街？

我 每次同佢傾電話，都係要搞盡心思好似tum女上床咁乞求佢去，佢老母咁你話點解唔答佢無？因為答無仲撚大鍋，佢就會打俾我事頭婆然後又再loop一次佢被 人非禮果單野問我事頭婆知唔知刑事起訴係限期架，你地唔好以為過一排我就會無左件事呀，我同你講，我無原諒過你地架，係你地叫我俾次機會你地架咋，我依家 都係觀察中，睇下你地有無誠意咁，如果俾我發現你地係無既話，唯有法庭見架咋

我屌，我有時諗，我真係寧願坐監都唔想再咁樣被佢折磨。我有一次真係絕望到問我事頭婆，其實我地係咪被人玩定係中左天仙局？

咁講返同呀Jolly講電話，係要好有技巧，佢通常打黎既開場白就係 1.喂，你係咪打過俾我？ 2.點解你地公司做野咁架？ 3.上次叫你講過ｄ野你有無做架？

而我必須要咁答： 1.哦係呀係呀 2.對唔住呀，我地會盡力做返好 3.有架有架，跟緊架啦

跟 住就要同佢講一輪唔撚那更既野啦，包括梁振英施政，雙非孕婦，Chanel no.5邊度有得賣，Hermes新一季有咩新款，D自由行好貴乞人憎，然後就要乞求佢話呀Jolly姐，我地今晚呢係邊度邊度有個dating喎，不如 你考慮下有無興趣黎呀，如果有既話我可以安排一下，而通常佢都係話無架喎，但佢又唔係真係唔會黎架喎，因為通常係開始之前既半個鐘度啦，佢就會話自己咁岩 係附近同friend食完飯無野做好得閒咁又咁岩諗起我地公司，於是就會賞面光臨

話說事頭婆送俾Jolly姐個plan我地公司裡面俗稱叫廚房plan，喻意sit灶啦，係專比d萬年老姑婆用，亦因為個plan咁撚強橫，Jolly姐亦得以橫行曬係幾乎我地公司既所有佢合資格既dating裡面

多人果d我都由佢，佢老母系有時三對三咁佢又要叉隻腳，屌佢咩，咪變左唔對稱囉，搞到我地成日被人嘈，但又有乜計，佢癲架嘛

如是者搞左好似都有成半年有多，我果排真係生不如死，後尾終於有一位阿生打救左我，我真係到依家都好感激佢，而佢亦都係我人生裡面其中一個最撚佩服既男人

話說果日我又乞求到Jolly姐賞面光臨，咁我通常都會成隻狗咁係門口度heheheahea咁恭迎佢，而佢條仆街亦都會好準時咁遲到半粒鐘

咁果日係一個比較多人既event黎，即係會有MC玩下game然後輪盤咁換台果d黎 咁呀Jolly姐去到之後人地就玩緊game架啦，佢老母臭系真係無句好口，一入到摺一聲，仲要摺到好撚大聲，然後話：咦，咁鬼多人，污煙瘴氣

嘩屌，我真係想兜巴昇柒佢老母臭系，即係我已經唔介意被佢當狗咁屌，但係佢咁樣真係好影響其他人，最緊要係好影響到我份工呀嘛

咁人地玩緊game，佢講完句野又唔郁又唔剩，企撚左係度扭下扭下咁，老母系呀，佢拮起條尾我都知佢想點啦，咁我點呀，咪九秒九咁衝過去話呀Jolly姐，大家玩緊game喎，不如你都黎玩吓啦

唉玩就玩啦，無無聊聊咁

我果陣開始有D明白點解古時D太監大部份都心理變態，即係如果我日日都要服侍個咁撚西既女人呢，我真係遲早痴線，但係係果晚，我人生迎黎左轉機，因為係果晚，有個男人，呀，唔係，係男神，打撚左Jolly姐一巴，係，係兜巴車左落去佢老母系塊面度

果 陣我記得應該係玩到ice breaking差唔多最後一隻game，咁隻game係有少少身體接觸既，真係好少好少揸下手仔咁上下架咋，但係你知Jolly姐係幾咁身嬌肉貴架啦， 咁其實當我醒起run到呢隻game果陣，我都哎呀左一聲，個心仔都啵啵咁跳望撚實呀Jolly姐大佬保你大唔好又搞事

咁話說呀Jolly既partner，就係果位男人中既男人，咁Jolly姐都係扭扭拎拎掂下手仔又喂又剩啦，跟住呀男神生呢，嘩，佢一野fing開左Jolly姐隻手仔，然後好撚不羈咁屌左一聲：麻撚煩

我果下真係媽大口呆撚左，你地明唔明果種又好撚開心但係又好撚擔心既既感覺？

但係，但係咩呢，我果吓我望到呀Jolly姐個樣真係呢，佢直程係嬲到我見到佢額頭d青筋係跳下跳下咬撚牙根條頸果d筋呀乜撚都出曬黎好似就黎要爆咁，跟住佢果隻指住呀男神生既手指震下震下咁，嘩你知唔知我果個moment幾撚驚？

你講咩呀

Jolly姐指撚住呀男神生黎屌，已經係全場人望到實一實，我聽到Jolly姐係嬲到聲都變撚埋，但係呀男神生係理都無撚理過佢

然後呀Jolly姐就開始控制唔到自己啦，我真係唔知佢黎緊M都M都無撚得黎，佢癲到捉撚住人地隻手用手指篤撚住人地下巴人地塊面黎屌，我諗果下Jolly姐應該有諗過將呀男神生分屍

跟住就黎上帝顯靈既一幕啦，其實我個人黎講啦就唔同意打女人，咁但係呢如果係話有條友咁撚沙po連Jolly姐都夠膽打既話，咁又唔撚同喎

話說呀男神生被呀Jolly姐捉住黎屌之後，電光火石間佢一巴車左落去Jolly姐塊面度，我諗果個moment情況真係好撚危急，如果唔係呀男神生係唔會一巴打到呀Jolly姐連塊面D粉飛出黎

之後發生既事我唔係好記得啦，因為果一巴之後我係成個都進入了一種恍恍惚惚既狀態，我淨係記得呀男神生好撚瀟灑頭也不回咁攞袋走左，然後呀MC係被塊面被Jolly姐刮左幾下既同時攔住左佢無搞出人命

然後你估Jolly姐點呀......

佢喊，佢坐撚左係地下度喊

臭系，佢都有今日啦

但係有幾風流就有幾耐折墮，雖然我連風流都未風流過，第二日，Jolly又抄上黎公司，仲要指名搵我，我果下係認左命，我同你講，我果個moment既心情，係同係雨傘革命裡面果D話要去自首既人係一樣架

入到我office房，Jolly姐好冷靜，佢好平淡咁同我講，比果個人資料我

咁我亦都好耐心咁同佢解釋，客人既資料呢，因為有關私隱，係唔可以比你既

果下我真係豁左出去，告咪告囉，我都唔想煩，點知Jolly姐話佢原來已經問過律師，話傷人告唔入，不過咁，佢講左樣我真係諗都無諗過既野

佢話佢要指名一對一約琴晚兜巴星柒佢既果位先生

咁話說我地公司係可以有咁既要求，當然基本上都係最貴既plan先有架啦，咁仲要雙方都係join過同一個活動，即係見過面啦，仲要經我地問下對方有無興趣咁先得既

咁Jolly姐咁樣講一講，佢老母系佢又真可以咁樣要求喎呀屌你老味呀我真係估唔到

係Jolly姐走左之後，咁打俾呀男神生，男神生基本上係match Jolly姐既要求既，除左學歷無咁高之外，點解呢，因為呀男神生呢，係從事呢個建築行業既

咁我打俾佢，同佢講，話果晚果位同你有ｄ掙執既女士想約你黎個單對單既約會，唔知你有無興趣呢

咁呀男神生靜左幾秒，然後好霸氣咁講：好呀，驚系呀

嘩，你老味，我真係呢世人未見過ｄ咁撚豪邁粗獷既男人，我有理由相信，佢就係Jolly姐既真命天子，果個唯一可以馴服佢呢隻癲雞既男人中既男人

我幫佢地約左係灣仔一間幾高級既餐廳，主要就貪佢比鄰呢個律敦治醫院啦（附24小時急症室）

現場黎講呢火藥味就相當濃厚，而正如我好前面講過，係呢d私隱度高既單對單安排度，我地係會係確到雙方到左現場之後就撤退，而令我頗為欣慰既就係呢，係我走之前都係未有任何傷亡既

之後發生既事其實唔係呃你，不過我就唔清楚，之不過果晚之後我就可以唔洗晚晚熄左電話先訓得著，lunch hour仲都終於可以食返餐安樂茶飯

大 概半年之後啦，我就收到一張請帖既，一如大家所料啦，請帖係由男神生同Jolly姐發既。係佢地婚禮上面，我真係好開心，認真既，點解呢，其實做呢行呢， 見到每個臭西嫁得出，都有一種成功感而同時亦有一種好似老豆嫁女既感覺，係好窩心架其實，因為會覺得自己做左件好事令兩個人得到幸福，唉，諗起佢地可以有 情人終成眷屬我都有Ｄ眼濕濕
